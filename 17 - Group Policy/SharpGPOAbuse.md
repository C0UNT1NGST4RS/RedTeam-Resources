[SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse)Â allows a wider range of "abusive" configurations to be added to a GPO. It cannot create GPOs, so we must still do that with RSAT or modify one we already have write access to. In this example, we add an Immediate Scheduled Task to the PowerShell Logging GPO, which will execute as soon as it's applied.

As all the machines in the domain refresh their GPOs (or if you do it manually), many Beacons you shall have!
