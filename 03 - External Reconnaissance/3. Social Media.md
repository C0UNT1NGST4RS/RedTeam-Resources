For several years, social engineering and phishing have been the most prolific methods for gaining access to a target environment. To prepare your own campaign, sites such as LinkedIn are a goldmine of information because people expose a lot of professional (and sometimes personal) information about themselves.

We love to demonstrate how good we are at Task X or managing Product Y - and this information is not only useful for knowing what products are being used, but also for generating your pretext. The pretext is the "story" behind why we want our target to open our email and carry out the desired actions.

The pretext can be rather generic and sent to multiple targets or targeted to an individual or small group. Tailoring the pretext to something a user will either relate to or have an interest in, will give us a better chance of success. And there are also emotional characteristics that will statistically result in higher user engagement - in particular, fear, urgency, greed and curiosity.

Two examples could be:

-   Human Resources – URGENT: Grievance filed against ...
-   Accounts Payable – FINAL NOTICE: Invoice 1234 not paid

The following "[Google Dork](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)" can be used to quickly scrape LinkedIn for employees of a particular organisation:  **site:"linkedin.com" "<company name>"**

Some of the more interesting information you can glean from a LinkedIn profile includes names, current and previous job roles, location (on-site or remote), contact info (websites, social media, email addresses), previous experiences, education, qualifications, certifications, personal interests and 1st, 2nd and 3rd-degree connections.

**EXERCISE**  
  
Conduct some additional external reconnaissance against the lab targets at [https://cyberbotic.io](http://www.cyberbotic.io/) and see if you can find any information that would be useful in a phishing campaign.
