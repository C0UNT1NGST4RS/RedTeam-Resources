### Phases of an Engagement

An overall engagement can be broken down into three main phases:

	1.  Planning
	2.  Doing
	3.  Reporting

The engagement begins by performing external reconnaissance against the target gathering information such as public-facing applications, IP ranges, domain names, technologies and products used, employees, organisational structure, service providers, suppliers and more. This information is then used to plan an attack on the perimeter.

Once a foothold has been obtained in the target organisation, the team will perform internal reconnaissance. The aim is to understand everything possible about the environment including network topology, internal systems & processes and defensive products & capabilities. They may also install backdoors on the foothold(s) to ensure they can maintain persistent access to the environment without having to re-perform the initial compromise steps.
