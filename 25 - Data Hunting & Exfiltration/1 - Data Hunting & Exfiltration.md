Organisations will store data in a wide variety of places from file shares, databases, SharePoint, internal wiki's and so on.  As a red teamer, you need to find the "objective" of your operation and then prove **access** to that objective to your client.  I emphasise "access" specifically, because you do not want to actually copy or move sensitive data out of its location, particularly in regulated environments.

When planning the assessment with your client, a good strategy to suggest is to create a dummy data repository that is subject to all the same security controls but doesn't actually contain any real data (it could be fake or obfuscated data).  That data can be generated by you or the client and would be safe to remove from the environment.

Otherwise, you can prove access to real data, but carry out an exfiltration exercise with dummy data.  It can have the same structure and properties as the real data, but the content itself would not be sensitive.

Exfiltration exercises are an important step to gauge how effectively an organisation can detect and respond to their sensitive data being removed by whatever means (email, HTTP, FTP etc).
