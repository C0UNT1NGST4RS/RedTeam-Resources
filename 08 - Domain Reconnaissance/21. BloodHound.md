[BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) is an application that uses graph theory to display the relationships between different Active Directory components, specifically for the use case of finding attack paths. BloodHound requires the use of two additional components: a [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database and the [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound3) data collector.

To configure neo4j and BloodHound, go to your **attacker-windows** VM and open a **Command Prompt**. Change directory to `C:\Tools\neo4j\bin` and run `neo4j.bat console`.
```shell
C:\Users\Administrator>cd C:\Tools\neo4j\bin

C:\Tools\neo4j\bin>neo4j.bat console
2021-05-11 10:03:21.143+0000 INFO  Starting...

```

Open a web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:7474/**. Enter **neo4j** for both the username and password, and click **Connect**. You'll be prompted to set a new password - pick something you'll remember and click **Change Password**. You may now close the browser.

Go to `C:\Tools\BloodHound`, launch `BloodHound.exe` and login with your new password.

The database will be empty, so it's time to run the data collection with SharpHound.

SharpHound has a number of different collection methods (all documented on the repository):

-   **Default** - Performs group membership collection, domain trust collection, local group collection, session collection, ACL collection, object property collection, and SPN target collection
-   **Group** - Performs group membership collection
-   **LocalAdmin** - Performs local admin collection
-   **RDP** - Performs Remote Desktop Users collection
-   **DCOM** - Performs Distributed COM Users collection
-   **PSRemote** - Performs Remote Management Users collection
-   **GPOLocalGroup** - Performs local admin collection using Group Policy Objects
-   **Session** - Performs session collection
-   **ComputerOnly** - Performs local admin, RDP, DCOM and session collection
-   **LoggedOn** - Performs privileged session collection (requires admin rights on target systems)
-   **Trusts** - Performs domain trust enumeration
-   **ACL** - Performs collection of ACLs
-   **Container** - Performs collection of Containers
-   **DcOnly** - Performs collection using LDAP only. Includes Group, Trusts, ACL, ObjectProps, Container, and GPOLocalGroup.
-   **ObjectProps** - Performs Object Properties collection for properties such as LastLogon or PwdLastSet
-   **All** - Performs all Collection Methods except GPOLocalGroup.

**OPSEC Alert**
>Running collection methods such as **LocalAdmin**, **RDP**, **DCOM**, **PSRemote** and **LoggedOn** will allow SharpHound to enumerate every single computer in the domain. Collecting this information is useful to BloodHound and without it you may see fewer paths, at the obvious expensive of being loud on the wire.

SharpHound will write a ZIP file in the current working directory of the Beacon, so ensure you move somewhere writeable first.

By default, SharpHound will target the current domain. To enumerate a foreign domain, use the `-d` option.

This will download the files to the Team Server. To save them onto your desktop go to **View > Downloads**, select the files, click **Sync Files** and choose somewhere to save them. It works this way so that every operator connected to the Team Server has access to the same files.

In BloodHound, click the **Upload Data** button in the menu on the right and select your ZIP files. Once the files have been extracted, click the **More Info** button in the top-left - the DB Stats and On-Prem Objects should now be populated.

There are multiple ways to search for data in BloodHound.

Since we have a Beacon running as **bfarmer**, a good first step could be to find if he has any local admin rights on machines in the domain. Use the search box in the top-left to find bfarmer. Scroll down the **Node Info** tab until you find the **Local Admin Rights** section. Click on **Group Delegated Local Admin Rights** and BloodHound should show a simple graph displaying the relationship between bfarmer and **SRV-1**.

It shows us that bfarmer is **MemberOf** the **Developers** domain group, which is **AdminTo** SRV-1.
![[Pasted image 20220831122518.png]]

You can right-click on any edge and select **Help** to see more information about what that relationship means, how you might exploit it, any OPSEC considerations as well as additional references.
![[Pasted image 20220831122526.png]]

The path finder (the little road icon next to the search box) allows you to plot a path between two specific nodes. Specify a start and target node, and BloodHound will plot the shortest path (if it can find one). For example, searching for a path from **jking** to the **Oracle Admins** group should show that jking is a member of **1st Line Support** which has a **GenericAll** ACL to Oracle Admins.
![[Pasted image 20220831122533.png]]

To find any path to a target node, find it using the search box, right-click the node and select **Shortest Paths to Here**.
![[Pasted image 20220831122541.png]]

Nodes (users/groups/computers) can also be "Marked as Owned" or "Marked as High Value". This provides a means of plotting paths using those tags, such as "Find Paths to Here from Owned" or "Find Paths to High Value Targets".

In the **Analysis** tab, you will find lots of built-in queries that can help you find interesting attack paths in the domain. BloodHound also allows you to execute raw cypher queries (at the bottom of the window). This is useful for finding nodes that have particular properties or to help find specific attack paths.

This query will show all users that have a **Service Principal Name** (SPN) set:
```shell
MATCH (u:User {hasspn:true}) RETURN u
```

And this query will display computers that are **AllowedToDelegate** to other computers:
```shell
MATCH (c:Computer), (t:Computer), p=((c)-[:AllowedToDelegate]->(t)) RETURN p
```

One of the pre-built queries in BloodHound is called **Shortest Paths from Kerberoastable Users**, which will attempt to plot a path to Domain Admin from any user with an SPN. However, in the lab, this will find no result. The real strength of custom cyber query (in my view) is to expand out those search parameters:
```shell
MATCH (u:User {hasspn:true}), (c:Computer), p=shortestPath((u)-[*1..]->(c)) RETURN p
```

This query will plot the shortest paths from any user with an SPN, to any computer - and will produce a path from **svc_mssql** to **SRV-1**.
![[Pasted image 20220831122625.png]]
(Don't worry if this specific paths make no sense - we'll be looking at them in more detail as we progress thrrough the course.)
