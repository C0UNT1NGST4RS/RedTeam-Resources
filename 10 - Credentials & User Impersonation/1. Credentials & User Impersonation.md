Gaining access to user credentials, or otherwise being able to impersonate the identity of a user is an important step for moving laterally and accessing resources in the domain. Red teams rely on obtaining legitimate user access in order to reach their objective rather than exploiting systems using CVEs etc.

Now that we've moved laterally to SRV-1, there are a few ways to see if any other users currently have a session here.

The Beacon `net` commands are built on the Windows Network Enumeration APIs. `net logons` will show any users currently logged onto the host.
```shell
beacon> net logons
Logged on users at \\localhost:

DEV\SRV-1$
DEV\jking
DEV\svc_mssql
```

We can also get a list of running processes.
```shell
beacon> ps

PID   PPID  Name                         Arch  Session     User
---   ----  ----                         ----  -------     -----
448   796   RuntimeBroker.exe            x64   1           DEV\jking
2496  716   svchost.exe                  x64   1           DEV\jking
2948  1200  sihost.exe                   x64   1           DEV\jking
3088  1200  taskhostw.exe                x64   1           DEV\jking
3320  3304  explorer.exe                 x64   1           DEV\jking
3608  796   ShellExperienceHost.exe      x64   1           DEV\jking
3800  796   SearchUI.exe                 x64   1           DEV\jking
4004  3320  shutdown.exe                 x64   1           DEV\jking
4016  4004  conhost.exe                  x64   1           DEV\jking
4472  1200  taskhostw.exe                x64   1           DEV\jking
[...snip...]
2656  716   sqlservr.exe                 x64   0           DEV\svc_mssql
```

We can see that both **jking** and **svc_mssql** are currently logged into SRV-1 and because we have local admin access, we can steal and/or impersonate their credential material.
