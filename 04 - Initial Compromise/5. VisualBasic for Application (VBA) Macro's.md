VBA is an implementation of Visual Basic that is very widely used with Microsoft Office applications - often used to enhance or augment functionality in Word and Excel for data processing etc. The prevalence of macro's in the commercial world is a double-edged sword when it comes to leveraging macro's for malicious purposes. On one hand, the presence of a document with embedded macro's is not necessarily suspicious; but because they _are_ used maliciously by threat actors, they are also given more scrutiny both from technical products (e.g. web/email gateways) and in security awareness training.

You can create a macro in a Word document by going to **View > Macros > Create**.  Change the "Macros in" field from "All active templates and documents" to "Document 1".

> If Office has fallen into an unlicensed state, follow the steps [here](https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/communities/Q29tbXVuaXR5LTIwMjMw/post/UG9zdC00MDc5MDYw/).

Give the macro a name and click **Create**. To force the macro to trigger automatically when the document is opened, use the name **AutoOpen**.

VBA is not all that different from VBScript, so it's not too difficult to use the same **wscript.shell** object previously.

```vb
Sub AutoOpen()

  Dim Shell As Object
  Set Shell = CreateObject("wscript.shell")
  Shell.Run "calc"

End Sub
```

To test the macro, use the play/pause/stop buttons.

The same 32/64-bit challenge is present here as well. If the target is running 32-bit Office on a 64-bit OS, we need to use the `sysnative` path for PowerShell.

To prepare the document for delivery, go to **File > Info > Inspect Document > Inspect Document**, which will bring up the Document Inspector. Click **Inspect** and then **Remove All** next to **Document Properties and Personal Information**. This is to prevent the username on your system being embedded in the document.

Next, go to **File > Save As** and browse to **C:\Payloads**. Give it any filename, but in the **Save as type** dropdown, change the format from **_.docx_** to **Word 97-2003 (.doc)**. We do this because you can't save macro's inside a `.docx` and there's a stigma around the macro-enabled `.docm` extension (e.g. the thumbnail icon has a huge `!` and some web/email gateway block them entirely). I find that this legacy `.doc` extension is the best compromise.

When an Office document with an embedded macro is opened for the first time, the user is presented with a security warning (assuming the environment isn't locked down to block macro's entirely). For the macro to execute, the user _must_ click on **Enable Content**.

Many real-life samples you may see try to entice the user to click this button - usually saying something along the lines of "Security product XYZ has scanned the content and deemed it to be safe. To reveal it, click Enable Content".

Now, let's finally look at sending these in a phish.

### HTA Phish

We're logged into OWA as **iyates** - let's send an email to **bfarmer**, starting with the HTA.

First, let's host the HTA on the Team Server so we can simply send a link for them to download and execute. Go to **Attacks > Web drive-by > Host File**. Select **demo.hta** and provide a URI to access it on. When sending emails from one staff member to another, consider the relationship between them and come up with an email "story" or "pretext" that makes sense.

I'll just call mine _staff-survey_.

Obviously, your HTA interface should resemble a staff survey form if this is the pretext you have chosen. Everything should come together and be as convincing as possible to the target user(s).

Access the console of **WKSTN-1** (which should automatically authenticate as **bfarmer**) and launch **Outlook**. Clicking the URL in the email should open IE and a window to **Open/Save/Save as**.

![[Pasted image 20220831114305.png]]

Click **Open** and you should get a Beacon running as **bfarmer**.

By default, Office has filetype filtering in place that will prevent you from attaching certain files to emails (including HTAs, which is why we'd opt to sending a link instead).

If you try to do so, you'll see a red crossed out circle icon on the attachment.

![[Pasted image 20220831114323.png]]

On the receiving end, the user will see a warning that an unsafe attachment was blocked.

### Word Doc Phish

The document can work well sent as an attachment.

Opening the document directly from Outlook and clicking Enable Content will spawn another Beacon as bfarmer.
