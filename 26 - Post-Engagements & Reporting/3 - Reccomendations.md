It's not always viable for a red team to provide an effective set of recommendations prior to discussions with the organisation, particularly defenders and incident responders. The red team have their own perspective on the engagement, which is only one side of the coin. In the example observation above, the red team observed no response, but that doesn't make it an accurate reflection of reality.

It could be that the blue team did detect the activity but failed to respond or respond appropriately.

Only through this two-way dialogue can the true gaps be identified.
