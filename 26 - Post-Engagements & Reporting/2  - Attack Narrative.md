An attack narrative should contain the observations made during the engagement, in chronological order. An example of an observation could be:

> A vulnerability on this host was identified which allowed an elevation of privilege to that of a local administrator. This enabled the red team to obtain the credentials of other users on this host, which included a Domain Administrator. The red team did not observe any indication that this activity had been detected."

In practice, an observation should be extended to include any relevant technical details.
