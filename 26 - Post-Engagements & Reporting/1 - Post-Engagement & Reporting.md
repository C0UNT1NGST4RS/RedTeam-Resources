The final reports that are issued by the red team are critical to get right. Once the engagement has concluded, these reports are needed by the organisation to help them implement any additional security measures as identified by the red team.

If you're coming from a penetration testing background, you may find this report writing incredibly difficult (I did). Many pentest reports can be boiled down to findings such as:

-   Missing Patch for CVE-XXXX-XXXX
-   CVSS Score: 10
-   Rating: Critical
-   Recommendation: Install patch from Microsoft

However, the issues identified during a red team engagement are much more holistic and systemic, and therefore much harder to address than simply installing patches. Given that these engagements are scenario-based, it leads to a report style that is much more "story-focused".
