Component Object Model (COM) is a technology built within the Windows operating system that allows intercommunication between software components of different languages. Imagine two applications written in two different languages that cannot natively talk with each other - COM offers standard interfaces which when implemented by those respective applications, allows information to flow between them.

Each COM component is identified via a class ID (CLSID) and each component exposes functionality via one or more interfaces, identified via interface IDs (IIDs). A COM class (coclass) is an implementation of one or more interfaces, represented by their CLSID or a programmatic identifier (ProgID).

In Windows, COM classes and interfaces are defined in the registry under **HKEY__CLASSES__ROOT\CLSID** and **HKEY__CLASSES__ROOT\Interface** respectively. There is also registration-free COM (RegFree COM) which allows a COM component to exist without using the registry. In this case, data such as CLSID is stored in an XML manifest file.

If we have a look at some random keys within HKCU\CLSID, we may see something like:

An in-process server allows the specified DLL (this DLL is the actual coclass implementation for this CLSID) to be loaded into the process space of the calling application - **InProcServer32** registers a 32bit in-process server. The **ThreadingModel** can be **Apartment** (Single-Threaded), **Free** (Multi-Threaded), **Both** (Single or Multi) or **Neutral** (Thread Neutral).

You may also find **LocalServer32**, which provides a path to an EXE rather than DLL.

[OleView .NET](https://github.com/tyranid/oleviewdotnet) also allows us to find and inspect COM components.

COM hijacking comes into play when we are able to modify these entries to point to a different DLL - one that we control. So that when an application tries to call a particular coclass, instead of loading **C:\\Windows\\System32\\ieframe.dll** (for example), it will load **C:\Temp\evil.dll** or whatever we specify. The danger with hijacking COM objects like this is that you **will** break functionality. Sometimes that will be a relatively mundane 3rd party application, it may be a critical business application or it may be the whole OS. Hijacking a COM object without an understanding of what it does or what it's for is a very bad idea in a live environment.

**HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT** is not the whole story when it comes to COM - when an application attempts to locate an object, there is a search order that it goes through. Machine-wide COM objects are located in **HKEY\__LOCAL_\_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes** and per-user objects in **HKEY\__CURRENT_\_USER\\Software\\Classes**. These locations are then merged to form **HKEY\__CLASSES_\_ROOT**.

Any user can hijack or even register new COM objects within HKCU - these only apply to themselves but they do take precedence over those in HKLM. So if a COM object is located within HKLM, we can place a duplicate entry into HKCU which will be executed first.
