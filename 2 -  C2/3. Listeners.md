### Listener Management

A "listener" is a host/port/protocol combination that "listens" for incoming communication from Cobalt Strike's payload, Beacon. The two main flavours of listeners are **egress** and **peer-to-peer**.

The egress listener that you will use the majority of the time is the HTTP listener. This listener acts like a web server, where the Team Server and Beacon will encapsulate their communications over HTTP. The "appearance" (bodies, headers, cookies, URIs etc) of this HTTP traffic can be tightly controlled using **Malleable C2 Profiles**, which we will cover in more detail towards the end of the course.

Peer-to-peer listeners allow Beacons to chain their communications together over **SMB** or **TCP**. These are particularly useful in cases where a machine that you compromise cannot reach your Team Server directly over HTTP.

To create an HTTP listener, go to **Cobalt Strike > Listeners** and a new tab will open. Click the **Add** button and a **New Listener** dialogue will appear. Select **Beacon HTTP** as the payload type and enter a descriptive name. This listener name is used in several Beacon commands (such as when moving laterally), so make sure it describes the listener well. Click the **\+** button next to **HTTP Hosts** which should autocomplete to the Kali IP address (10.10.5.120). This is fine, so click **OK**. Leave everything else as it is and click **Save**.
