[Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) is a .NET application written in C# that has various "host safety-checks". The information it gathers includes general OS info, installed antivirus, AppLocker, audit policies, local users and groups, logon sessions, UAC, Windows Firewall and more.

### Compilation

The majority of open source tooling on GitHub is provided as source code without pre-compiled binaries, so we have to compile them ourselves. Open **Visual Studio** (not Visual Studio Code), select **Open a project or solution** and select **C:\\Tools\\Seatbelt\\Seatbelt.sln**.

The first thing you'll see is a warning about the target framework not being installed.

![[Pasted image 20220831114742.png]]

The Seatbelt project is configured to target .NET Framework 3.5 which is not installed on our machine (or any of the machines in the lab for that matter). v3.5 is installed by default on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and very early builds of 10.

Each subsequent build of Windows 10 comes with a newer version of .NET Framework. A quick break-down:

|Windows Build|Default .net Version|
|:---:|:---:|
|1511|4.6.1|
|1607|4.6.2|
|1703|4.7|
|1709|4.7.1|
|1803, 1809|4.7.2|
|1909+|4.8*|
\* 4.8 is the last version of .NET Framework that Microsoft will release


You can enumerate the .NET Framework version installed on a host by reading the **Release DWORD** in the registry.

```shell
beacon> reg queryv x64 HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full Release

Release                  460805
```

Cross-referencing `460805` [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies) we can see this is v4.7.

So does this mean we have to enumerate the exact version of the .NET Framework installed on a target and compile the assembly for that specific version? No. The **Common Language Runtime** (CLR) is a component of the .NET Framework that manages the execution of .NET assemblies, and each .NET Framework release is designed to run on a specific version of the CLR.

|**.NET Framework Version**|**CLR Version**|
|:---:|:---:|
|2.0, 3.0, 3.5|2|
|4, 4.5-4.8|4|


From the table above, we can see that .NET Framework v3.5 executes on CLR v2; and all 4.x versions execute on CLR v4. This is the primary consideration when choosing a .NET Framework target. This means that (for instance) a .NET assembly that has been compiled to target v4.5 will still run on a machine that only has v4 installed.

So in Visual Studio, just click **OK** to change the target framework to 4.6.1. Then go to **Build > Build Solution**. This will compile Seatbelt to the following path: `C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Debug\Seatbelt.exe.`


### Execution

The `execute-assembly` command allows Beacon to run .NET executables directly from memory, so (generally speaking) there is no need to upload these tools to disk before running them.

```shell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Debug\Seatbelt.exe -group=system
```

This command will produce quite a lot of output, but do take the time to look through it all.

In terms of security configurations, these are some interesting entries:

```shell
====== AppLocker ======
[*] Applocker is not running because the AppIDSvc is not running

====== LAPS ======
LAPS Enabled                  : True

====== OSInfo ======
IsLocalAdmin                  :  False

====== PowerShell ======
Script Block Logging Settings
Enabled                       : True

====== Services ======
Non Microsoft Services (via WMI)

Name                          : Sysmon64
BinaryPath                    : C:\Windows\Sysmon64.exe
FileDescription               : System activity monitor

====== Sysmon ======
ERROR: Unable to collect. Must be an administrator.

====== UAC ======
[*] LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy == 1. Any administrative local account can be used for lateral movement.

====== WindowsFirewall ======
Domain Profile
  Enabled                  : False

Private Profile
  Enabled                  : False

Public Profile
  Enabled                  : False
```

Enumerating the user's environment with `-group=user` can be equally important. For instance, this mapped drive entry shows us that elements of the user's profile is mounted on a remote share.

```shell
Mapped Drives (via WMI)

  LocalName                      : H:
  RemoteName                     : \\dc-2\home$\bfarmer
  RemotePath                     : \\dc-2\home$\bfarmer
  Status                         : OK
  ConnectionState                : Connected
  Persistent                     : False
  UserName                       : DEV.CYBERBOTIC.IO\bfarmer
  Description                    : RESOURCE CONNECTED - Microsoft Windows Network
```

This is commonplace as it allows user's files to follow them in a working environment where they may not be logging into the same computer each time. If we list `C:\Users\bfarmer`, we actually see there is no Desktop, Documents or Downloads folder. This is because they are mounted on H.

```shell
beacon> ls H:\

 Size     Type    Last Modified         Name
 ----     ----    -------------         ----
          dir     05/25/2021 09:34:38   Desktop
          dir     02/25/2021 13:06:01   Documents
          dir     02/23/2021 15:16:33   Downloads
```
