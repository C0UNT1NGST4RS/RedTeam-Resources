The Security App in Kibana allows us to build detections that will generate alerts automatically, and provides tooling to aid investigation and remediation.  I've pre-built some alerts that will come into play as you progress through the course, but you may wish to modify them or even build your own.

There is no alert for Office child processes, so let's build that now.

From within the Security app, click on **Rules** in the left-hand menu.  Then click **Create new rule** in the top-right.  There are different rule types available, for this rule we'll use **Custom query**.  Under the **Index patterns** heading, remove all the indexes except for **winlogbeat**.  This is the index the Sysmon events are going into.

Copy and paste the same search query used in the previous lesson into the **Custom query** box.  You can also save queries that you use often and re-use them here.  Click the **Preview results** button to make sure there is data being returned from the query.

Click **Continue** and fill out some supplementary information about the rule including a name, description and severity etc.  There are other cool things you can do like associate the rule with MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

Under Schedule Rule, I will set both **runs every** and **look-back time** to 5 minutes.

We're not going to associate any actions with this rule, so leave the **Actions frequency** to **Perform no actions**.  Actions that can be performed include sending an email; raising tickets in Jira or ServiceNow; or sending a message via Teams or Slack.

Finally, click on **Create & active rule**.

  

This rule is now active for data generated from now, they do not retrospectively go back through historical data.  To see the alert in action, execute your macro payload again and go to the **Alerts** view in the app.  Remember that the rule will run every 5 minutes, so the alert won't appear until the next time the rule is run.  You can see a rule's last run time in the **Rules** view.

Soon, you'll see a new open alert.

Click on **View detail****s** (icon of diagonal line with two arrows) to get a summary of the alert.  It will give you some information such as the hostname, username, the parent process name and the process arguments that were spawned.

Click on **Analyze event** (little cube icon) to get the awesome looking process tree.
