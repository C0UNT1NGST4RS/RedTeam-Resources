Before we carry out any post-exploitation steps, it's prudent to take stock of the current situation. Every action that we perform carries some risk of detection. The level of that risk depends on our capabilities and the capabilities of any defenders. We can enumerate the host for indicators of how well it's being protected and monitored. This can include Antivirus (AV) or Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) software, Windows audit policies, PowerShell Logging, Event Forwarding and more.

"Defence in Depth" is a concept by which multiple (independent) layers of security controls are placed throughout a system or environment - the intent is to provide a level of redundancy so in the event one fails, others remain. We must be prepared to bypass multiple layers of security.

"Offence in Depth" is a similar concept for red teamers. The information gathered here should be used to shape the actions you carry out or the tactics you employ. For instance - if you have a favourite PowerShell script that performs "X" but PowerShell logging is enabled, you may need to avoid performing "X" altogether, or find an alternate means of doing it (e.g. .NET instead of PowerShell). Good offensive engineers will have multiple tools or methodologies for achieving the same outcome.
