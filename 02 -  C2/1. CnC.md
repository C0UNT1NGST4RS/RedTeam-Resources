### Command & Control
Command & Control, often abbreviated to C2 or C&C, is the means by which an adversary can perform actions within a compromised environment. During the initial compromise phase, a malicious payload is executed that will call back to infrastructure controlled by the adversary. This payload is commonly referred to as an "implant", "agent" or "RAT" (Remote Access Trojan). This infrastructure is the central control point of an engagement and allows an adversary to issue commands to compromised endpoints and receive the results.

The capabilities of these implants will vary between frameworks, but in general they have the ability to execute different flavours of code and tooling to facilitate the adversarial objective(s), such as shell commands, PowerShell, native executables, reflective DLLs and .NET; as well as network pivoting and defence evasion.

Implants will most commonly communicate with this infrastructure over HTTP(S) or DNS, and can even talk to each other over a peer-to-peer mesh using protocols such as SMB and TCP. These protocols are utilised because they will typically blend into most environments.

Many commercial and open-source C2 Frameworks exist including Cobalt Strike, SCYTHE, Covenant, PoshC2, Faction, Koadic, Mythic and the Metasploit Framework. Each framework has their own sets of strengths and weaknesses - the [C2 Matrix](https://www.thec2matrix.com/matrix) is a curated list of frameworks that can be filtered by their features and capabilities.
