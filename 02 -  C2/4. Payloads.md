### Generating Payloads

To generate a payload for this listener, go to **Attacks > Packages > Windows Executable (S)**.

Cobalt Strike is able to generated both staged and stageless payloads. Whenever you see **(S)** within the UI, it's an indication that it's using a stageless payload.  Select the HTTP listener created previously, select **Windows EXE** as the output and tick **Use x64**.

**OPSEC Alert**
```
Staged payloads are good if your delivery method limits the amount of data you can send. However, they tend to have more indicators compared to stageless. Given the choice, go stageless.  
The use of 64-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems is preferable to using 32-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems.

Click **Generate** and save the file to **C:\Payloads**. Now execute that EXE and you should see a new Beacon appear.
