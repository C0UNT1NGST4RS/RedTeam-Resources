To interact with a Beacon, simply right-click it and select **Interact**. This will open a command line interface where you can enter various commands. To get a list of available commands type **help**.

```shell
beacon> help

Beacon Commands
===============

    Command                   Description
    -------                   -----------
    argue                     Spoof arguments for matching processes
    blockdlls                 Block non-Microsoft DLLs in child processes
    browserpivot              Setup a browser pivot session
    cancel                    Cancel a download that's in-progress
```

To get more detailed help for a command, type `help <command>`.

```shell
beacon> help inject
Use: inject [pid] <x86|x64> [listener]

Open the process and inject shellcode for the listener
```

Parameters wrapped in `[ ]` are mandatory, whilst those in `< >` are optional (although the default value won't always be what you want).

By default, Beacon will check into the Team Server every 60 seconds. To lower this, we can use the **sleep** command.

```shell
beacon> sleep 5
[*] Tasked beacon to sleep for 5s
[+] host called home, sent: 16 bytes
```

**OPSEC Alert**
```
Fast check-in times can increase the chance of the Beacon traffic being caught. You can also add a jitter to randomise the check-in time by a given percentage.
```

Some Beacon commands (such as **sleep**) don't provide output, instead you will see a **"host called home"** message to let you know that Beacon has checked in and received the job. There are also some features of the UI (such as the **File Browser**) that cannot be accessed on this command-line interface. Instead, you must right-click on a Beacon and use the popup menu (e.g. **Explore > File Browser**).
